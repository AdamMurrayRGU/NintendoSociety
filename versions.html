	<h3> The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) </h3>
	<p> The Super Nintendo Entertainment System, or better known as the SNES was released in 1992. Even at this consoles it may have cemented itself as one of Nintendo's finest consoles with a bunch of fan favorite games released on it, such as Super Mario World, Yoshi's island, The Legend of Zelda a Link to the Past, Super Metroid, Donkey Kong Country, and so many other fantastic games.</p>
<br>

	<h3> The Nintendo 64 (N64) </h3>
	<p> The Nintendo 64 was released in 1997 with revolutionary 3D graphics! Before the N64 the closest Nintendo had to 3D graphics was in Star Fox for the SNES, but that wasn't real 3D like what the N64 can do. With this console we saw many fan favorite games released, such as Super Mario 64, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of time/ Majoras Mask. Mario 64 changed gaming forever!</p>
<br>

<img src="images/GBA.jpg" alt="GBA" width="auto" height="150px" style="float:right">
	<h3> The GameBoy Advance (GBA)</h3>
	<p> The GameBoy Advance was released in 2001, it was basically just a more powerful Gameboy, unfortunatly some people fount this console to be very boring by Nintendo's standards, but that didn't mean it was bad by any means. Most of the most notable games were ports of previous games, like the mario advanced series which was a bunch of the 2D Mario games with a new coat of paint over it and maybe a few changes, and the Donkey Kong Country triliogy being re released as well. </p>
<br>

<img src="images/Gamecube.jpg" alt="gameCube" width="auto" height="150px" style="float:left">
	<h3> The GameCube </h3>
	<p> Fun fact! The gamecube was originally called dolphin as a codename, and there is a picture of a dolphin on one of the components inside. but other than that the Gamecube was released in 2002 with a fantastic line up of games, such as Luigis mansion, Mario Sunshine, Super Smash Bros Melee, The Legend of Zelda Wind Waker, and so many other great games. The GameCube also has one of the best controllers made.also Nintendo put a handle on the back of the console for "portability"?</p>
<br>

<img src="images/DS.jpg" alt="DS" width="auto" height="150px" style="float:right">
	<h3> The DS </h3>
	<p> The DS was almost immidiatly one of Nintendo's most sold consoles, it was released in 2005 alongside games such as Super Mario 64 DS, New Super Mario Bros, WarioWare Touched, Nintendogs among other fun games for the whole family, this consoles main gmmicks were that it had a touchscreen, and it could fold in half. This revolutionised the hand held console market, so much so that Nintendo would make multiple variations.</p>
<br>

<img src="images/Wii.jpg" alt="Wii" width="auto" height="150px" style="float:left">
	<h3> The Wii </h3>
	<p>If gaming wasn't mainstream before, this was the console that got everyone onboard, the Wii was released in 2006, and was an instand hit with people of all ages, with its new motion controls gaming had never been so interactive. The wii launched with Wii sports, Wii play, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, and later on got many other amazing games like Mario Galaxy.</p>
<br>

<img src="images/3DS.jpg" alt="3DS" width="auto" height="150px" style="float:right">
	<h3> The 3DS </h3>
	<p>The 3DS was just a more advanced DS, the same way that the GameBoy Advance was an upgraded GameBoy, as you probably could have guessed this consoles main gimmick was that it could make games look 3D, it was really cool but the 3D feature was probably underutilised. Thisconsole had a few pokemon games, a few Mario games and a bunch of Kirby games released on it.</p>
<br>

<img src="images/Wii_U.jpg" alt="WiiU" width="auto" height="150px" style="float:left">
	<h3> The Wii U </h3>
	<p>Now admittidly the Wii U was one of nintendos most under whelming consoles, it was just a Wii with an I pad pretty much, this was released in 2012, and many fans thought this would be the end of Nintendo, but luckly they pulled through, there were a good bunch of great games on this console though, although most of them were ported over to Nintendos next console, except from Super smash bros Wii U, but thats the only good game that was left behind, and even that was replaced. </p>
<br>
	
<img src="images/Switch.jpg" alt="Switch" width="auto" height="150px" style="float:right">
	<h3> The Switch </h3>
	<p>The Switch is Nintendo's latest console, it was released in 2017 and instantly bacame of of Nintendos best received and best sold consoles, the Switch is both a hand held and a home console with its detachable controllers that are called Joy-cons.
