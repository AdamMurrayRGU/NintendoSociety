      <p class="content">The RGU Nintendo Society offers facilities for members to trade, battle and collect pokemon in a variety of versions (As far back as Pearl/Diamond to as recent as Sword/Shield), as well as hosting events for collectors, players and enthusiasts of the Pokemon Trading Card Game, including a small bi-annual Tournament with a community-sourced prize pool.

        <h3>In-Game Trading & Battling</h3>
      </section>

      <p class="content">At our meetings on-campus, it is easy to find other members playing the same game as you, who are always looking to trade pokemon or compete in pokemon battles. The society's coordinators are usually willing to explain concepts in competetive pokemon to you, such as IV and EV values, if you like. Off-campus, the society has a group chat set up for internet trading of pokemon in Sword/Shield and OmegaRuby/AlphaSapphire.

        <h3>Pokemon TCG</h3>
      </section>
      <p class="content">On campus, the society offers times where a space may be organised for trading cards and staging matches with Pokemon TCG decks. Friendly matches can be played with any generally viable deck - current tournament illegal cards can be used as desired, from any set.

      We also try and stage Pokemon TCG tournaments bi-annually. Every member who participates contributes a small portion into the prize pool, and the final winner takes all. These tournaments are, of course, limited to contestants using currently tournament-legal decks only.

      Our organising members will be happy to answer most questions you might have about the trading card game, such as how to build a deck, the basic rules of play, and even more nuanced deckbuilding strategies, if beginners would like advise.
